                        <h4>Master Front-End Frameworks: </h4>
                        Through HNG internship, 
                        I intend to master frontend frameworks such as ReactJs and NextJs by solving real-world problems. 
                        This I will achieve through active participation in tasks, 
                        assigned projects and feedback from mentors.

                        Certifications make up for experience, 
                        hence I plan to earn my certification through participation and commitment to project completion.
